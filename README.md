# Martian Token Crowdsale

KaseiCoin is fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library. Martian Aerospace Agency wants to mint KaseiCoin and put on sale for human colony on Mars. “Kasei” means “Mars” in Japanese. You will launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.
## Usage Scenario: Martian Token Crowdsale

Assume you will create a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a `Crowdsale` contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract that you create will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. Your contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

The following steps can guide about the process involed in this challenge:

- Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract
- Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract
- Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract
- Deploy the Crowdsale to a Local Blockchain
- Verify the transactions in MetaMask wallet and Ganache sandox environment
